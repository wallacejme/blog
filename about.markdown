Hi!

My name is Wallace, and this is my technical blog.

I created this as a way to exercise my expressiveness regarding professional subjects.
Here, I'll share some of my thoughts and discoveries thorought my life as a software developer and former Computer Science student.

I've recently started a journey towards finding my place into this vast and complex world. So many technologies, so many frameworks and stacks.

**_Where will I fit in?_** â€” there is the question. I might have some ideias, but a lot remains to be enlightened.

Some of my progress, decisions and choices will be shown here. So, stick around if you're interested. You can [add my RSS feed](https://wallacemedeiros.com/blog/feed.xml) to you favorite feed reader to keep yourself up-to-date.

You can find more about me at [my main website](http://wallacemedeiros.com). **Important note:** I'm Brazilian, so some of my stuff might be in Portuguese.
