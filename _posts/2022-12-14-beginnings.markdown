Creating a blog has populated my mind since it was cool. My habit of postponing tasks brought me here, starting a blog when they're no longer read.

> To be honest, I've already started some online writing sometimes â€” you can check them on my [medium profile](https://medium.com/@wallacejme).

But I'm also stubborn. I'll do it anyway.

Anyway, my name's Wallace and I'm a 31yo Brazilian software developer with 6 years of professional experience working with mostly backend development.

I also have some knowledge with building and consuming RESTful APIs, Android development and some frontend frameworks.

Recently, I decided to became a decent full-stack developer, then I elected some languages/frameworks/tools to focus on:

- Frontend: [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) + Native [Android](https://developer.android.com/)
- Backend: [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor) (or [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), not sure) + [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres)
- Some other complementary tools, like Docker.

That said, I intend to log my progress here.
So, if you're interested on reading about Programming or related stuff, you might be interested on showing up here later.

Best regards.
See you soon.
